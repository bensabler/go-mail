1. Extract exit codes into named constants
2. Extract help text into a const
3. Add a tiny helper to reduce repeated fmt.Fprintln(errOut, "...") patterns (still same messages)
4. Reuse one allowed map for head flags (so it isn’t reallocated each call)
5. Clarify and lock down “jagged row policy” in README (pad vs truncate, and why).
6. Add a --strict mode in the future (error on width mismatch instead of normalizing).
7. Consider validating empty header row (common corrupted CSV issue).
8. Add tests for ReadHead normalization behavior (short rows padded, long rows truncated).
9. Document CSV NULL semantics explicitly in README:
9a. NULL == empty field on output
9b. Why literal "NULL" is input, not output
10. Clarify that headers are never modified by nullify
11. Decide whether CellsNullified should:
11a. count already-empty values (currently: no)
11b. or strictly count policy matches (currently: no)
12. Add a short example in README showing before/after nullify
13. Add a golden test that asserts:
13a. header row is preserved byte-for-byte
13b. row count is preserved
13c. only expected fields change
