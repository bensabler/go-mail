1. Extract exit codes into named constants
2. Extract help text into a const
3. Add a tiny helper to reduce repeated fmt.Fprintln(errOut, "...") patterns (still same messages)
4. Reuse one allowed map for head flags (so it isn’t reallocated each call)
5. Clarify and lock down “jagged row policy” in README (pad vs truncate, and why).
6. Add a --strict mode in the future (error on width mismatch instead of normalizing).
7. Consider validating empty header row (common corrupted CSV issue).
8. Add tests for ReadHead normalization behavior (short rows padded, long rows truncated).
